# Feature Engineering 

### Problem:

A machine learning model is requested to be developed that can predict whether individuals are diabetic or not when
their features are specified. Before developing the model, it is expected that necessary data analysis and feature
engineering steps to be performed.

### Dataset Story:

The dataset is a part of a large dataset held at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
in the United States. The data is used for diabetes research conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and over living in
Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona in the USA. The target variable is defined as "outcome",
indicating whether the diabetes test result is positive (1) or negative (0).

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies before
- Glucose: 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test.
- Blood Pressure: (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness
- Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin. (mu U/ml)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration in the oral glucose tolerance test)
- BMI: Body mass index
- Age
- Outcome: Having the disease (1) or not (0).
